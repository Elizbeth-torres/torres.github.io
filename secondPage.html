Elizabeth being curious, she sat up and looked arround and realized they stopped at a beautiful place but she was a little disappointed because it wasn't what she wanted to see. Her mom spoke up "We are making a quick stop to explore and look round" with a soft and lovely smile on her face and Elizabeth felt so excited and jumped out of the car and went sightseeing with her parents, with a huge smile on her face.</p>
